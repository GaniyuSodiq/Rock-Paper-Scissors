    Rock paper scissors - PROBLEM AND SOLUTION BREAK DOWN

STEP 1 UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
It is a game mostly played by 2 individuals by forming a hand symbol.
The two players draw their hand at the same time after the saying the trigger words together.

A fist represents rock. 
A peace represents scissors. 
And an open hand represents paper.

Rock beats scissors but losses to paper.
Paper beats rock but loses scissors.
Scissors beat paper but loses to rock.

The result is a tie if both players form the same hand symbol.

STEP 2 PLAN THE SOLUTION
•	Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
IT WILL BE PLAYED ON THE CONSOLE

•	What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
THE USER WILL INPUT “R” FOR ROCK, “P” FOR PAPER, “S” FOR SCISSORS.
THE OTHER PLAYER WHICH IS COMPUTER, GENERATES ANY OF THE 3 RANDOMLY.

•	What’s the desired output?
A MESSAGE ON SCREEN TELLING US THE FIRST PLAYER TO GET TO 5 POINTS AS WINNER

•	Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
THE USER’S POINT START AT 0
THE COMPUTER’S POINT START AT 0
THE SYSTEM BEGIN THE FIRST ROUND
THE SYSTEM TAKES IN WHAT THE USER PRESSED AMONG R P S AS A VALUE
AND RANDOMLY GENERATES THE COMPUTER’S VALUE
COMPARES THE TWO VALUES AND GIVES A POINT TO THE RIGHT PLAYER USING 
	ROCK VS SCISSORS = ROCK WINS
	SCISSORS  VS PAPER = SCISSOR WINS
	PAPER VS ROCK = PAPER WINS
THE SYSTEM STORES THE POINT FOR THE OR THE WINNER
THE SYSTEM BEGINS THE NEXT ROUND SO FAR NONE OF THE USER IS AT 5 POINT
IF A USER GETS TO 5 POINTS, THE USER IS CROWNED A WINNER AND THE GAME ENDS

STEP 3 PSEUDOCODE THE SOLUTION

THE SYSTEM BEGIN THE FIRST ROUND
Initialize the point of user to 0
Initialize the point of computer to 0
Initialize a count for the number of rounds to 1
THE SYSTEM TAKES IN WHAT THE USER PRESSED AMONG R P S AS A VALUE
Prompt the user to enter a value between r,p,s 
AND RANDOMLY GENERATES THE COMPUTER’S VALUE
Randomly generate a value between 3 options
COMPARES THE TWO VALUES AND GIVES A POINT TO THE RIGHT PLAYER USING 
Compare the rom the user against the value generated for the computer
	ROCK VS SCISSORS = ROCK WINS
	SCISSORS  VS PAPER = SCISSOR WINS
	PAPER VS ROCK = PAPER WINS
THE SYSTEM STORES THE POINT FOR THE WINNER
The winner’s point is increase by 1	
IF A USER GETS TO 5 POINTS, THE USER IS CROWNED A WINNER AND THE GAME ENDS
End the game if a user’s point gets to 5
THE SYSTEM BEGINS THE NEXT ROUND SO FAR NONE OF THE USER IS AT 5 POINT
The game starts again with the round count increase by 1 

---
Initialize the point of user to 0
Initialize the point of computer to 0
Initialize a count for the number of rounds to 1
Prompt the user to enter a value between r,p,s 
Randomly generate a value between 3 options
Compare the value from the user against the value generated for the computer
If rock vs scissors = rock wins
	If scissors  vs paper = scissor wins
	If paper vs rock = paper wins
The winner’s point is increase by 1
